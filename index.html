              <p>Governments around the world spend over $9.5 trillion of public money every year on contracts to purchase goods and services for their citizens.</p>
              <p>But often citizens do not have access to information about who gets this money, what was agreed and what it buys for them.</p>
              <p>Without proper mechanisms for transparency and accountability, public money can be lost to fraud, bribery, corruption, waste, overcharging, and under-delivery by private contractors.</p>
              <p>We believe that everyone should be able to see how money flows from the public purse into private hands to enable essential public interest advocacy, reporting and reforms.</p>
              
              <h2>Fraud: undermining trust and robbing the public</h2>
              <img src="img/fa18.jpg" alt="F-A-18 Returns from a mission over Afghanistan" />
              <p>Far from the prying eyes of central governments, the defence sector offers great opportunities for fraud. The contracts are huge, and often highly secretive, providing an ideal breeding ground for corruption and deceit. It is estimated that <a href="http://www.transparency.org/topic/detail/defence_security">$20 billion dollars is lost every year</a>; losses which are hidden by governments and their contractors behind veils of &ldquo;national security&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>Take KBR Inc, formerly a subsidiary of the infamously rapacious oil and security giant Halliburton. One of the US government’s key contractors in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, they are currently on trial for large scale fraud following the discovery of numerous irregularities in their accounts. Why did they buy fuel tankers at triple their value from a Kuwaiti subcontractor? Why were they using unsanitised mortuary lorries to transport ice for consumption by US soldiers? Perhaps it has something to do with the $1million in bribes received by KBR employees from their Kuwaiti friends. Such cases are estimated to have cost $60billion in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, in a bonanza for corrupt corporations looking to make a quick buck in a crisis. </p>
              <p>The money that is siphoned off by secretive subcontracts is cash which could have been spent on schools, roads and hospitals. The lives of those who work for the army are imperilled by the provision of shoddy equipment. And trust in the government and security services is fatally undermined for a public who sees nothing but pigs at the trough.</p>
              <p>We must stop secrecy in contracting, to make sure public money everywhere is being spent on the things that people need, and not pocketed by politicians and businessmen. Sign the petition now.</p>
              
              <h2>Corruption: causing local suffering globally</h2>
              <img src="img/gas-flares.jpg" alt="Niger Delta Gas-Flares" />
              <p>Every year, Africa loses around 25% of its GDP to corruption. This takes the form of bribes and of stolen resources among other things, but of course the real cost of corruption is counted in the absence of the hospitals, schools, clean water, roads and bridges that might have been built with that money. Corruption also fuels unrest, as the relationship between the people and their government breaks down. </p>
              <p>In the Niger Delta, an oil-rich region in west Africa, the daylight robbery of the people by an alliance of political and business elites has produced one of the world’s most desperate armed struggles. While 2 million barrels of oil are siphoned out of the region every single day, not a single new road has been funded by the government in 10 years. </p>
              <p>The Nigerian economy is now 60% dependant on the oil revenues from the Delta region, and yet the population of the region has become steadily poorer since the 1960s as they have been forced from the land by the environmentally devastating extraction practices. One in four Africans lives in mineral-rich countries, but corruption and mismanagement mean that the profits rarely make it back to the communities most in need. </p>
              <p>And corruption is not just a problem for Africa. This month we heard that the European economy is leaking money at an astonishing rate of 120 billion euros per year. High-level corruption scandals in the past year have seen resignations in France, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, among others. One of the grubbiest cases came out of Greece, where a former defence minister has been jailed for accepting 50 million euros in bribes while overseeing the contracts for Russian and German arms. </p>
              <p>A crucial first step in tackling corruption is giving citizens full and open access to contracts. Sign now to call on world leaders to make this happen. </p>
              
              <h2>Corporate takeover: democracy for sale</h2>
              <img src="img/g4s.jpg" alt="Group 4 Securicor" />
              <p>Across the world, more and more public services and being provided by private contractors. In the UK, the outsourcing market is now valued at £82 billion per year.</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Just looking at the figures … it seems like you have become versions of government departments. … It seems that you, the big corporates, sow up all the taxpayers’ money. … At least with the state the taxpayer has redress, because he can vote for a different government.&rdquo;</em> Robert Halfon, MP for the Conservative Party [source]</p>
              <p>Take G4S. A shady security company who control everything from ticket inspectors to prison guards, homes for asylum seekers to stewards at the Olympics, G4S receive close to £1 billion from UK taxpayers each year for the provision of public services. They are one of a new breed of mega-corp: huge multinationals providing similar (dis)services to citizens across the world, with little or no accountability. </p>
              <p>G4S stand accused of truly appalling crimes. A G4S guard at a children’s prison killed a teenage boy, Gareth Myatt, by choking, and was promoted to Safety and Health Manager of their Children’s Services. Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan deportee, was killed during “restraint” by G4S guards, and an elderly man, Mr Ward, was baked to death in the back of a G4S van in Australia. </p>
              <p>G4S are also accused of defrauding the UK government of millions of pounds, and of incompetence in almost everything they put their hand to, most famously at the London Olympics. Yet those who use their services have no voice against them, and as the public belt gets pulled tighter and tighter, the contracts keep on rolling in. </p>
              <p>When our public services are run by secretive private companies, we get no say in how they are run. We have lost democratic control over our essential infrastructure: our energy policy, our transport systems, our water.</p>
              <p>All private companies who receive public money to deliver public services must be subject to the same requirements as governments when it comes to transparency. It’s time for secrecy in outsourced contracts to stop. Sign the petition now.</p>
